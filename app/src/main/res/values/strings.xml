        The aim of this game is to form compounds or elements in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of mistakes. \n \n
        - Drag an element on top of another element to form a compound. \n \n
        - To turn a compound back into its reactants, double tap on it, and shake the phone. This may be irreversible in some instances&#8230;
        However you may reset to restore your elements and compounds to their original positions.
